    "#1 What is the purpose of Python's OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "#2 Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?\n",
    "\n",
    "The inheritance search is simply a search of the tree from bottom to top looking for the lowest occurrence of an attribute name.\n",
    "\n",
    "#3 How do you distinguish between a class object and an instance object?\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between the two is that an object represents a set of instances while an instance is a certain, specific representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#4 What makes the first argument in a classâ€™s method function special?\n",
    "\n",
    "The first argument of every class method, including init, is always a reference to the current instance of the class. By convention, this argument is always named self.\n",
    "\n",
    "#5 What is the purpose of the init method?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is called as a constructor in object oriented terminology. This method is called when an object is created from a class and it allows the class to initialize the attributes of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#6 What is the process for creating a class instance?\n",
    "\n",
    "To create instances of a class, you call the class using class name and pass in whatever arguments its init method accepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#7 What is the process for creating a class?\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a Class. To create a class, use the keyword class\n",
    "Create Object. Now we can use the class named MyClass to create objects\n",
    "The self Parameter\n",
    "Modify Object Properties\n",
    "Delete Object Properties\n",
    "Delete Objects.\n",
    "#8 How would you define the superclasses of a class?\n",
    "\n",
    "The class from which a class inherits is called the parent or superclass. A class which inherits from a superclass is called a subclass, also called heir class or child class.\n",
